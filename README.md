## Overcoming Technical Challenges
One of the most challenging aspects of the project was integrating the payment gateway for hardcopy purchases. Initially, we faced issues with securely processing transactions and ensuring data privacy. Using the STAR method, here’s how we resolved it:

Situation: We needed to implement a secure payment system to process hardcopy book purchases.
Task: Integrate Stripe as our payment gateway and ensure compliance with data security standards.
Action: We thoroughly researched Stripe’s API and consulted documentation to understand best practices for secure integration. We implemented SSL encryption to protect user data during transactions.
Result: After rigorous testing and multiple iterations, we successfully integrated Stripe, providing a seamless and secure payment experience for our users.
